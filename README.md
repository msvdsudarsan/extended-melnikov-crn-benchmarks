# Extended Melnikov Method for Higher-Dimensional CRNs

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and reproducible numerical
benchmarks used in the research article:

**“Extended Melnikov Method for Higher-Dimensional Chemical Reaction Networks”  
M. S. V. D. Sudarsan (2025)**

The codes reproduce the numerical values reported in Table 1 of the manuscript
(Extended Melnikov runtimes and error metrics for substrate inhibition, enzymatic
feedback, and the balanced modified Oregonator).
